Minimum value: Total physical RAM in MB divided by 64
Maximum value: Total physical RAM in MB divided by 2
Default value: 0
The default value is a nonexistent key.
If you add values that are out of range, your computer will revert to the default behavior.
The value that you add is measured in MB.

4 gigs of ram (4096/64=64)
00000040
8 gigs (8192/64=128)
00000080

the numbers need to be in hex or import and use regedit to change
